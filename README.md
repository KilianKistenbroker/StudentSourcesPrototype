## Overview

**Student Sources** is a college project I developed alongside a team for my Software Engineering capstone course. The purpose of this website is to help students study by providing tools to organize and share lecture notes among peers. **Student Sources** is inspired by other cloud-based file organization sites like Dropbox and OneDrive, but with more of a social implementation. Our user interface provides features to easily search up other users in our database to view and download any of their publicly shared files and folders. Additionally, users can comment on other users' public files and form chat groups with each other.
